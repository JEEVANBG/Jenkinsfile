Target groups for your Network Load Balancers
Each target group is used to route requests to one or more registered targets. When you create a listener, you specify a target group for its default action. Traffic is forwarded to the target group specified in the listener rule. You can create different target groups for different types of requests. For example, create one target group for general requests and other target groups for requests to the microservices for your application.

What is a Network Load Balancer?

Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets. Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer as your incoming traffic changes over time. It can automatically scale to the vast majority of workloads.

Elastic Load Balancing supports the following load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, Gateway Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select the type of load balancer that best suits your needs. 

A load balancer serves as the single point of contact for clients. Clients send requests to the load balancer, and the load balancer sends them to targets, such as EC2 instances, in one or more Availability Zones.

To configure your load balancer, you create target groups, and then register targets with your target groups. Your load balancer is most effective if you ensure that each enabled Availability Zone has at least one registered target. You also create listeners to check for connection requests from clients and route requests from clients to the targets in your target groups.

Listeners for your Network Load Balancers

Before you start using your Network Load Balancer, you must add one or more listeners. A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure. The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to the targets in one or more target groups.
