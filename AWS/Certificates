AWS Certificate Manager :
      AWS Certificate Manager is a service that allows you to easily issue, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for usage with AWS services and internally connected resources.
      SSL/TLS certificates are used to protect network connections and establish the identity of websites on the Internet as well as resources on private networks. 
      AWS Certificate Manager automates the time-consuming manual process of purchasing, uploading, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates.
