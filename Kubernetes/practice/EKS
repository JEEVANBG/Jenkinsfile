Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS):
        Is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain our own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. 
        Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

Amazon EKS:
      - Runs and scales the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
      - Automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version updates and patching for them.
      - Is integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications, including the following capabilities:
        * Amazon ECR for container images
        * Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution  
        * IAM for authentication
        * Amazon VPC for isolation
      - Can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modifications.

Amazon EKS control plane architecture :
        Amazon EKS runs a single tenant Kubernetes control plane for each cluster. The control plane infrastructure isn't shared across clusters or AWS accounts. The control plane consists of at least two API server instances and three etcd instances that run across three Availability Zones within an AWS Region. Amazon EKS:

        - Actively monitors the load on control plane instances and automatically scales them to ensure high performance.
        - Automatically detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, restarting them across the Availability Zones within the AWS Region as needed.
        - Leverages the architecture of AWS Regions in order to maintain high availability.

Prequisets are:
        - install aws cli
        - install kubectl
        - install eksctl

Getting started with Amazon EKS is easy:
        - Create an Amazon EKS cluster in the AWS Management Console or with the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDKs.
        - Launch managed or self-managed Amazon EC2 nodes, or deploy your workloads to AWS Fargate.
        - When your cluster is ready, you can configure your favorite Kubernetes tools, such as kubectl, to communicate with your cluster.
        - Deploy and manage workloads on your Amazon EKS cluster the same way that you would with any other Kubernetes environment. You can also view information about your workloads using the AWS Management Console.
