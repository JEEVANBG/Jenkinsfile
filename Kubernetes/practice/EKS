Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS):
        Is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain our own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. 
        Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

Amazon EKS:
      - Runs and scales the Kubernetes control plane across multiple AWS Availability Zones to ensure high availability.
      - Automatically scales control plane instances based on load, detects and replaces unhealthy control plane instances, and it provides automated version updates and patching for them.
      - Is integrated with many AWS services to provide scalability and security for your applications, including the following capabilities:
        * Amazon ECR for container images
        * Elastic Load Balancing for load distribution  
        * IAM for authentication
        * Amazon VPC for isolation
      - Can easily migrate any standard Kubernetes application to Amazon EKS without any code modifications.
