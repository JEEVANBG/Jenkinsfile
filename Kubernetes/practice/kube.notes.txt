Probes:
      - Kubernetes provides probes (health checks) to monitor and act on the state of Pods (Containers).
      - And to make sure only healthy Pods serve traffic. 
      - With help of Probes, we can control when a pod should be deemed started, ready for service, or live to serve traffic.

Probes are used to detect:
      - Containers that haven’t started yet and can’t serve traffic.
      - Containers that are overwhelmed and can’t serve additional traffic.
      - Containers that are completely dead and not serving any traffic.

Types of Probes
Kubernetes gives you three types of health checks probes:
- Liveness
- Readiness
- Startup

Liveness Probe
      - Liveness probes let Kubernetes know whether your app (running in a container inside Pod) is healthy.
      - Indicates whether the container is running.
      - If app is healthy, Kubernetes will not interfere with pod functioning. If app is unhealthy, Pod will be marked as unhealthy. If a       - Pod fails health-checks continuously, the Kubernetes terminates the pod and starts a new one.
      - Liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.
      - Kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. If the liveness probe fails, the kubelet kills the container, and the container is subjected to its restart policy.
      - Configure a health check that periodically checks if your application is still alive. Containers can be restarted if the check fails.
      - Kubelet will periodically send a GET request to the Pod and expect a response; if the Pod responds between 200–399 then the kubelet considers that Pod is healthy; otherwise, the Pod will be marked as unhealthy.

Readiness probe :
      A readiness probe indicates whether the application running on the container is ready to accept requests from clients: If it succeeds, services matching the pod continue sending traffic to the pod. If it fails, the endpoints controller removes the pod from all Kubernetes Services matching the pod.

n Kubernetes, probes are managed by the kubelet. The kubelet performs periodic diagnostics on containers running on the node. In order to support these diagnostics, a container must implement one of the following handlers:
      - ExecAction handler—runs a command inside the container, and the diagnostic succeeds if the command completes with status code 0.
      - TCPSocketAction handler—attempts a TCP connection to the IP address of the pod on a specific port. The diagnostic succeeds if the port is found to be open.
      - HTTPGetAction handler—performs an HTTP GET request, using the IP address of the pod, a specific port, and a specified path. The diagnostic succeeds if the response code returned is between 200-399.
